# Fork of JSch-0.1.55 for Java 1.7

See original [README](README)

## Building

- Download the latest **Ant 1.9** from the [official site](https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi) and place its `lib` directory into the `tools` directory (e.g. you should have `tools/lib/ant.jar`). *Do not use Ant 1.10 or newer* if you wish to compile with Java 1.7 or earlier.
- Set `JAVA_HOME` to a JDK 1.7 installation directory.

- Run `build.bat` (on Windows) or `build.sh` (on Linux).

The resulting JAR is placed in `dist/lib`.
